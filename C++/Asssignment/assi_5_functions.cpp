Easy peasy , ignore this assign. if you want!
Write a function to print squares of the first 5 natural numbers.
#include<iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a;
    cout<<"Enter the size of vector : ";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter the vector : ";
    vector <int> v(a);
    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++)
    {
        cin>>v[i];
    }
    cout<<"Squares of number is : ";
    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++)
    {
        cout<<v[i]*v[i]<<" ";
    }
    return 0;
}
Output:-
Enter the size of vector : 5
Enter the vector : -100 22 0 -150 00
Squares of number is : 10000 484 0 22500 0 

Rest all questions were all soo easy that they were not even worth mentioning so , if your reading this file , jump on to next assign. 
its much more interesting than this one!
